#+title: Q&A
** Transient commands
~calibredb~ supports ~Transient commands~ just like ~magit~. Most of the features are binded in ~Transient commands~. You can press ~?~ to checkout.

- ~calibredb-dispatch~: Invoke a calibredb command from a list of available commands in ~*calibredb-search*~ buffer.
- ~calibredb-entry-dispatch~: Invoke a calibredb command from a list of available commands in ~*calibredb-entry*~ buffer.
- ~calibredb-set-metadata-dispatch~: Set metadata.
- ~calibredb-export-dispatch~: Export files.
- ~calibredb-catalog-bib-dispatch~: BibTex operation.
- ~calibredb-yank-dispatch~: Invoke a Yank operation.

** What is my working library?
=M-x calibredb=, your current library path shows in the header in buffer =*calibredb-search*=
Besides, variable =calibredb-root-dir= also saves the current library location.

** How to open an ebook?
1. =M-x calibredb=
   - In =*calibredb-search*= buffer, move the cursor to the ebook you want to open.
   - Press =RET/o/O/V= to open it.
   - If you are using macOS, you can also press =,= to quick look the ebook.

2. =M-x= =calibredb-find-helm= or =calibredb-find-counsel=
   - Select the ebook you want to open in the list
   - Press =RET= to open it.

3. =M-x calibredb=
   - In =*calibredb-search*= buffer, move the cursor to the ebook and press =v= to
     show details, or just =Right Click= on the ebook.
   - Then in =*calibredb-entry*= buffer, press =o/O/V= to open it.

** How to add ebooks?
1. =M-x calibredb-add=, select, mark ebooks (only ivy supports mark/unmark currently -
   with =ivy-hydra=, in ivy-window, press =m= to mark, =DEL= or =u= to unmark.
   Other engines can only select one item) and add to current library.

2. =M-x calibredb-add-dir= and select one directory, all supported formats will be added into current library.

3. =M-x dired=, mark the files, then =M-x calibredb-dired-add=, marked files in =dired= will be added
   to current library. After adding process ends, =dired= will ask the user delete the files or
   not.

Please notice: Add books may fail! There are some reasons:
- The book already exists in the database. If you still want to add the duplicated books, you can set ~calibredb-add-duplicate~ to ~Non-Nil~.
- Not all book formats are supported. If you can not add a specific book, check the logs in ~*calibredb*~ buffer.

** How to remove ebooks?
1. =M-x calibredb=
   - move the cursor to the ebook you want to delete, press =d=, calibredb will
     ask you to delete or not.

2. =M-x= =calibredb-find-helm= or =calibredb-find-counsel=
   - Select the ebook you want to delete in the list
   - =C-i= (Helm) =C-o= (Counsel) to enter the action menu.
   - Perform remove action as shown in the menu.

PS: If you want to delete in bulk with marked items, use ~calibredb-remove-marked-items~. ~m~ to mark items, ~D~ to bulk delete.

** How to switch virtual libraries?
First, set =calibredb-library-alist= to include the calibre virtual libraries.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq calibredb-virtual-library-alist '(("1. Development - work" . "work \\(pdf\\|epub\\)")
                                        ("2. Read it later" . "Readit epub")
                                        ("3. Development - rust" . "rust")))
#+END_SRC
Then, in =*calibredb-search*= buffer,
 - Press =l= to open the library list and select the library.
 - Press =n= or =p= to switch to next or previous library.

Or, in =*calibredb-search*= buffer, call =calibredb-virtual-library-list= directly and select
the library.

** How to switch libraries?
Set =calibredb-library-alist= to include the calibre libraries.

Make sure the libraries are valid. Create libraries using Calibre GUI or ~M-x
calibredb-clone~ to clone the existing library to a new library, before setting
it in ~calibredb-library-alist~.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq calibredb-library-alist '(("~/OneDrive/Doc/Calibre")
                                  ("/Users/damonchan/Documents/Books Library")
                                  ("/Users/damonchan/Documents/HELLO")
                                  ("/Users/damonchan/Documents/Books")
                                  ("/Users/damonchan/Documents/World")
                                  ("http://192.168.1.2/opds" "account" "password") ; https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web
                                  ("http://opds.oreilly.com/opds/")
                                  ("https://bookserver.archive.org/catalog/")
                                  ("http://arxiv.maplepop.com/catalog/")
                                  ("https://m.gutenberg.org/ebooks.opds/")
                                  ("http://www.feedbooks.com/catalog.atom")
                                  ("https://tatsu-zine.com/catalogs.opds")
                                  ("http://aozora.textlive.net/catalog.opds")))
#+END_SRC
Then, in =*calibredb-search*= buffer,
 - Press =L= to open the library list and select the library.
 - Press =N= or =P= to switch to next or previous library.

Or in =*calibredb-search*= buffer, call =calibredb-library-list= directly and select
the library.

If the library is not defined in =calibredb-library-alist=, you can call
=calibredb-switch-library= and select the path of the library that you want to
switch temporarily.

** How to set metadata on ebooks?
- In =*calibredb-search*= buffer, =m/DEL/u= to mark/unmark backward/unmark forward items, and =s= to set metadata
  in bulk. If you do not mark any items, actions will be performed on the item
  under cursor.
- In =*calibredb-entry*= buffer, press =s= to set metadata.
- In =*calibredb-search*= buffer, press =s f= to fetch metadata by
  author and title or =s i= to fetch by ISBN. For fetching by author and title
  enter one (or more) full lastnames of the author(s) (or delete redundant input
  from initial input). For fetching by ISBN enter the ISBN number (usually can
  be found and copied from on of the first pages of a book). As the title may
  contain the ISBN it is set as initial input. Wait few second for Emacs to
  retrieve metadata from the sources. Subsequently use =C-M-n/C-M-p= to select and
  preview the source to use for adding the metadata to the document. Press =RET=
  to add selected metadata to source.
- In =*calibredb-search*= buffer, press =s d= to fetch metadata by identifier.

Tips: You can filter the result via ~/~ before setting the metadata.

*** About ~fetch-ebook-metadata~
We are using ~fetch-ebook-metadata~ cli tool to fetch the metadata. However,
fetching ebook metadata is a little tricky, especially about the sources
configurations. Since the settings on calibre GUI would affect the
~fetch-ebook-metadata~ cli. Follow below steps to setup.

1. Set up the source settings in Calibre GUI. You are right, you need to configure the settings on GUI first.
   - Preferences -> Preferences -> Sharing/Metadata download
   - Tick 'source' you like to use
   - Set the 'Cover priority'
   - Apply
3. Specify the list of metadata download plugins to use, this should be the same as the calibre GUI configuration.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq calibredb-fetch-metadata-source-list '("Google" "Amazon.com" "Douban Books"))
#+END_SRC

** How to mark favorite/highlight/archive on ebooks?
- In =*calibredb-search*= buffer, =m= to mark the items, =f/h/x= to toggle
  favorite/highlight/archive status on marked items.

  Demo:
#+attr_org: :width 600px
  [[file:img/favorite_highlight_archive.png]]

** How to do live filtering?
- Press ~/~ to start live filtering. 

Minibuffer shows ~Filter (live)~, input some texts to start searching (REGEX is supported).

The following columns will be searched:
- id
- text (comment)
- tag
- title
- format
- author_sort
- ids

If the keyword occurs in any of the columns above, the matched ebook records will
be shown.

Here is the demo:
[[file:img/filter.gif]]

If you want to search by one type of metadata, for example, by tag, please check:
#+html: <a href="#how-to-do-group-filtering">How to do group filtering?</a>.

** How to do group filtering?
Press ~g~, then press
- t: fitler by tag
- f: filter by format
- a: filter by author
- d: filter by date
- l: filter by virutal library
- L: filter by library
- r: reset (clearing the search filter)

For example, after pressing ~g t~ then select any tags, group filter for tag is
enabled. In this case, minibuffer shows ~Filter (tag)~, if you press ~/~, it only search in tag.

If you press ~g r~, you can switch back to live filtering, and minibuffer will show ~Filter (live)~.

** How to do quick group filtering?
- Click the =calibredb-favorite-icon=, authors, file format, and tags.
- Press =r/R= to reset the filtering.

  Demo:

  [[file:img/quick_filter.gif]]

** How to do sorting?
Press ~o~, then press
- o: toggle the order (desc or asc)
- i: sort by id
- t: sort by title
- f: sort by format
- a: sort by author
- d: sort by date
- p: sort by pubdate
- T: sort by Tag
- s: sort by size
- l: sort by language

Configure ~calibredb-sort-by~ and ~calibredb-order~ to control the default sorting.

** How to interact with org-ref?
- Setup org-ref
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-ref)
  (setq calibredb-ref-default-bibliography "~/Desktop/catalog.bib")
  (add-to-list 'org-ref-default-bibliography calibredb-ref-default-bibliography)
  (setq org-ref-get-pdf-filename-function 'org-ref-get-mendeley-filename)
  #+END_SRC
  or
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package! org-ref
    :after-call calibredb
    :config
    (setq calibredb-ref-default-bibliography "~/Desktop/catalog.bib")
    (add-to-list 'org-ref-default-bibliography calibredb-ref-default-bibliography)
    (setq org-ref-get-pdf-filename-function 'org-ref-get-mendeley-filename))
  #+END_SRC

- In =*calibredb-search*= buffer, =b= =b= to generate the ebook catalogs with a BibTex
  file.
- The BibTex file is generated under current library path - =calibredb-root-dir=.
- Every time you switch your library, the corresponding BibTex file path will
  added into =org-ref-default-bibliography= temporarily.
- In an org file, =C-c ]= to insert cite.

  Demo:
  [[file:img/bib.gif]]


** Why the loading time is so long?
For some big libraries, such as the libraries that has 10000+ books, the package
will need a few seconds to query and decode all the metadata. This will be
improved in future versions.

You should know the following test results and behaviors so that it will not
frustrate you when dealing with big libraries:)

1. Tested with a library that has 8668 books, using 4.2 GHz Intel Core i7 in
   macOS 10.13.6, around =2= to =3= seconds to query the database.
2. *DO NOT* setq =calibredb-format-icon= t on big library. Tested with a library
   that has 8668 books, using 4.2 GHz Intel Core i7 in macOS 10.13.6, around =37=
   seconds to query the database.
3. The first time to enter =calibredb=, is to query and decode the whole database.
   After that, all data will be saved in =calibredb-search-entries=. Therefore,
   the next time to load the library is just reading =calibredb-search-entries=
   and show again. And you can feel much happier starting from the second time.
5. Update metadata, refresh dashboard, and switch library will re-query and
   decode the whole database.

** Can not remember the keybindings?
Press ~?~, it will show you almost all actions.

** How to edit annotation with org-mode?
In =*calibredb-search*= buffer,
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
M-x calibredb-edit-annotation
#+END_SRC
Or press ~i~.

By default, the annotation would be saved to =comments= field. If you want to
change to other filed, please set with the following statement:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq calibredb-annotation-field "comments")
#+END_SRC

Please notice: Due to the limitation of *calibredb*, the blank new lines will be deleted.

** How to search in ebooks directly?
We wrap ~counsel-ag~ in ~calibredb-rga~, using the power of [[https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all][ripgrep-all]].
First, install [[https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all][ripgrep-all]],
then in =*calibredb-search*=, =*calibredb-entry*= buffer or under =pdf-view-mode= / =nov-view-mode=,
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
M-x calibredb-rga
#+END_SRC

** How to interact with calibredb files in org files?
In ~*calibredb-search*~ buffer,
- ~y y~ copy as calibredb link. If you click the link, it will open the corresponding ~*calibredb-entry*~ buffer.
- ~y f~ copy as file org link. If you click the link, it will open the file directly.
